# Razorpay Clone Website (Frontend)


## Description
This repository contains the frontend part of a Razorpay website clone. I have created this clone using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The clone is designed to be fully responsive and is a faithful replica of the original Razorpay website.


## Features

- Responsive design: The clone is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
- Accurate replica: The layout, styling, and overall design closely resemble the original Razorpay website.
- HTML and CSS: The clone is built using standard web technologies, making it easy to understand and modify.
- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used to streamline the styling and layout of the clone, making it both efficient and maintainable.
